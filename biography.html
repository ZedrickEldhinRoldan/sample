                <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup><b>1</b></sup>I was born in Narvacan, Ilocos Sur. 
                <sup><b>2</b></sup>I grew up in a poor family.
                <sup><b>4</b></sup>My childhood was far from happy. 
                <sup><b>5</b></sup>As I had to face life's struggles at an early age.
                <sup><b>6</b></sup> When I was three, my mother went abroad, hoping to give us a better future.
                <sup><b>7</b></sup>But I was too young to understand what was happening.
                <sup><b>8</b></sup>Because of this, my grandfather returned from abroad to take care of me, and I couldn't help but feel anger toward my father for wasting all of my mother's hard work.
                <sup><b>9</b></sup>In Grade 4, I was forced to move to Manila because of my dad's actions. 
                <sup><b>10</b></sup>Adjusting to a new school and new classmates was incredibly difficult. 
                <sup><b>11</b></sup>The following year, I returned to Narvacan, thinking that my dad had finally changed, and for a while, it seemed like he did.
                <sup><b>12</b></sup>But as time  passed, he fell back into his old habits. 
                <sup><b>13</b></sup>Once again, our family became the talk of the town.
                <sup><b>14</b></sup>The judgment and gossip hurt, but one day, my cousins invited me to church, a place that would soon become my refuge.
                <sup><b>15</b></sup>At first, I didn't understand anything, but I saw the joy in people's faces, and slowly, I started to feel it too.
                <sup><b>16</b></sup>I learned how to play the drums and found comfort in new friendships, yet my family's problems never truly went away.
                <sup><b>17</b></sup>In Grade 6, I fell seriously ill, and at my weakest moment, my father remained distant, showing me no care or concern.
                <sup><b>18</b></sup>It was this painful reality that pushed my mother to finally come home.
                <sup><b>19</b></sup>Unable to bear the thought of me suffering alone. 
                <sup><b>20</b></sup>Though my family was still broken, her return brought me a sense of warmth and love that I had longed for.</blockquote></blockquote></p>

                <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup><b>1</b></sup>When I turned 13, I started high school, and school became my safe place. 
                <sup><b>2</b></sup>I made new friends, and being with them made me really happy.
                <sup><b>3</b></sup>Unlike home, where everything felt heavy, school was full of fun and laughter.
                <sup><b>4</b></sup>My friends brought joy into my life, but every time I went home, I felt sad again.
                <sup><b>5</b></sup>To escape, I spent more time at church and became part of the music ministry.
                <sup><b>6</b></sup>I prayed every night, hoping that one day, my family would come with me and change for the better.
                <sup><b>7</b></sup>After some time, I convinced my mom to join, and to my surprise, she didn't just attend, she became one of the lead singers. 
                <sup><b>8</b></sup>My dad, however, stayed the same, lost in his bad habits.
                <sup><b>9</b></sup>When my older brother was about to enter college, my mom had to return abroad, leaving me, my dad, and my grandfather at home.
                <sup><b>10</b></sup>Life became even harder when we found out that my dad was drowning in debt, and with my brother's school expenses, we didn't know how to survive. 
                <sup><b>11</b></sup>Soon after, my parents separated, and everything felt like it was falling apart.
                <sup><b>12</b></sup>Because of this, I stopped going to church and only focused on school. 
                <sup><b>13</b></sup>I was happy at school, but once I got home, I felt down again. 
                <sup><b>14</b></sup>I envied my friends because their families were complete and happy, while mine was broken. 
                <sup><b>15</b></sup>Then, when I turned 16, something unexpected happened, my dad apologized.
                <sup><b>16</b></sup>Even though he had hurt us, we forgave him because he was still our father.
                <sup><b>17</b></sup>Later on, my parents got back together, and a year aftermthat, my mom came back home.  
                <sup><b>18</b></sup>That was also when I returned to church, but my dad still refused to come.
                <sup><b>19</b></sup>At first, I thought he would never change, but after a few months,
                he finally joined us.
                <sup><b>20</b></sup>The biggest surprise was that, over time, he became the one waking
                us up every Sunday for church, that was the happiest moment of my life because I finally
                saw how much things had changed, and I knew it was a blessing.</blockquote></blockquote></p>

                <sup><b>2</b></sup> Adjusting to life in the city felt impossible, and my first week in the dorm was the loneliest time of my life.
                <sup><b>3</b></sup>I cried a lot because I missed my family and my old friends.
                <sup><b>4</b></sup>During my first semester, I had no friends at all, so I had to rely on myself for everything.
                <sup><b>5</b></sup>I wanted to go home so badly because I felt so alone. 
                <sup><b>6</b></sup>But in my second semester, everything changed, I finally found friends, and I was so thankful that they were good people with kind hearts.
                <sup><b>7</b></sup>Unlike others who got into bad company, I was lucky to be surrounded by friends who truly cared. 
                <sup><b>8</b></sup>They became my constant companions, and we shared many great moments together. 
                <sup><b>9</b></sup>However, college was still stressful, and sometimes, the workload became too much. 
                <sup><b>10</b></sup>There were times when I thought about transferring schools because of how overwhelmed I felt.
                <sup><b>11</b></sup>I also had to work hard because I felt a lot of pressure from my parents, who had high expectations of me.
                <sup><b>12</b></sup>But my friends were always there for me, comforting and encouraging me to keep going. 
                <sup><b>13</b></sup>They were different from my old friends, and I knew I could always count on them.
                <sup><b>14</b></sup>As a probinsyano, living alone in the city was a big challenge, and it took me months to adjust.
                <sup><b>15</b></sup>Here, I also learned how to save money and budget wisely.
                <sup><b>16</b></sup>Thankfully, I had real friends who made everything easier. 
                <sup><b>17</b></sup>The happiness I felt when I was with them was priceless, and I knew I could trust them in anything.
                <sup><b>18</b></sup>They became one of the biggest blessings in my life, giving me the strength to keep fighting. 
                <sup><b>19</b></sup>No matter what I was going through, I never heard a single word of anger from them, only love and understanding, studying while being far from home was never easy, and there were so many struggles I had to overcome.
                <sup><b>20</b></sup>But I learned that having the right people around me made a huge difference, my friends may not be able to help me financially, but their kindness and support were worth more than anything money could buy.</blockquote></blockquote></p>
